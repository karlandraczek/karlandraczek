Hi, I’m Karl Andraczek.
My research focuses on understanding biodiversity’s role in ecosystem functioning, particularly how their feedbacks respond to global changes. I explore how these relationships scale across space and time, including both aboveground and belowground dimensions. Using advanced quantitative tools, experiments, and observations, I aim to clarify the causal relationships and underlying mechanisms, while also exploring their potential for nature-based solutions.

In my current post doc project at sDiv, I am investigating biodiversity's role in ecosystem functioning, especially if belowground plant functional diversity can enhance our understanding of ecosystem functioning, including its stability in response to climate change.
